  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 5, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the QR Scanner app (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information in compliance with Google Play policies and applicable privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our app may collect or process the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information (User-entered):</strong> When using the “My Card” feature, users can voluntarily enter their name, phone number, email address, and other contact information to generate a QR code. This information is processed locally on the device and is not transmitted or stored on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and App Information:</strong> Automatically collected by Firebase Analytics and Google AdMob, including device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID), device type, operating system version, app activity (e.g., screen views, session duration), and crash logs. This data helps us analyze usage patterns and improve app performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide app functionality, including QR code creation, scanning, and storage on the user’s device.</li>
    <li>To display personalized or non-personalized ads through Google AdMob.</li>
    <li>To analyze usage and performance trends via Firebase Analytics.</li>
    <li>To ensure stability and improve user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share user-entered personal information (such as name, email, or phone number) with any third parties. However, third-party services integrated into the app (such as Google Firebase and AdMob) may collect and process certain technical or device data independently under their respective privacy policies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used for serving ads. May collect device identifiers (like Android Advertising ID), IP address, and app usage data for advertising and analytics purposes. See Google’s policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects aggregated usage data to help us understand how users interact with the app. More info: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions Used and Purpose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Used for scanning QR codes. No images or video are stored.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> Used for haptic feedback when scanning QR codes.</li>
    <li><strong>INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Required for ads and Firebase connectivity.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE & CHANGE_WIFI_STATE:</strong> Allows scanning and connecting to Wi-Fi QR codes.</li>
    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Used to save generated QR code images locally.</li>
    <li><strong>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID:</strong> Used by AdMob for advertising identifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>All data transmissions involving Firebase or AdMob occur over encrypted connections (HTTPS). Personal data entered by users stays on the device unless they choose to share it themselves (e.g., by sharing a QR code). We do not store or sell user data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not directed toward children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be reflected by the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of any changes.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or data handling, please contact us via the email provided on our Google Play developer page.</p>

  <p>By using the QR Scanner app, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
